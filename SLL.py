A linked list is a data structure contianing a head, tail and length property.
Linked Lists consists of nodes with each having a value and a pointer to another
node or null(if it is the last element in the list)

The term Singly comes from the fact that each node is SINGLY connect
to the next node. A doubly linked list points in both directions.

SLL's do not have indexs and do not allow for random access. They are mainly for
when you care about inserting and deleting and you just need to store a lot of
information and you don't need to randommly access the data.
